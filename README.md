# Crop-Cover
agriculture industry is vital to the economy of many developing
countries,
including Ghana, but many farmers still rely on outdated farming practices
that can lead to crop losses. Usually, after harvesting their crops farmers
have to dry their crops under the sun for some time. However the rain
can potentially destroy the crops being dried causing significant post-harvest
losses. To address this problem, we developed an Arduino-based system
equipped with a DHT11 sensor that measures humidity and temperature.
The sensor sends its input back to the microcontroller which controls a
servo motor that operates the rain shield to protect farm crops from the
rain. Our system provides an automated solution to crop protection that
can help to minimise the risk of crop damage and reduce post-harvest
losses. In this report, we describe the design and implementation of our
Arduino-based system and evaluate its performance under different
environmental conditions. We also provide a detailed analysis of the system's
hardware and software components, as well as its power consumption and
cost-effectiveness. Our results show that our system is highly effective in
protecting crops from rain and can be easily replicated in other agricultural
settings. Our project highlights the potential for technology, such as
Arduino-based systems, to improve efficiency and productivity in the
agriculture industry, particularly in developing countries. Overall, our work
demonstrates the importance of combining modern technology with
traditional farming practices to achieve sustainable agriculture and economic
growth.
